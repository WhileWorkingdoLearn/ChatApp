# ChatApp
 A Simple lightweigth Chatapp with javalin.

Tis is an Excercise Project for the next coumple of weeks/month. The goal is to build a Sessionbased Chatapplication. This means that no messages will be saved in the Backend. Users will only be able to write to other users, when they are currently online. 

User registration will most likly be resolved by a Keycloak server or other authentificationprovider.

Javalin is used, because it is lightweight and simple. I want to use as few frameworks as Possible for maximal experience gain.
